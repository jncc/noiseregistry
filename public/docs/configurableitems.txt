There are a number of items that can be configured through text files in the system.

The system will need to be redeployed after changes.

Messages
Although internationalisation was not a requirement for this project, the system has been designed with 
i118n internationalisation in mind in case there is a future need.  
The messages file (\conf\messages) contains almost all strings output by the application, and
these can all be configured by changing the text in this file. This includes:
- labels, field help, error messages, etc.
- the code for Google Analytics
- the static text for the initial welcome, feedback, help, cookies, contact and terms and conditions pages.  

Where multi-line text is required for an item in the messages file, each line prior to the last line 
must be terminated with a back slash (\).

Emails
All of the Scala templates for emails are in the \app\views.email directory.  The names of these should be self-explanatory.  
All emails use messages in the messages file, so almost all changes can be made there without touching the templates.

The weekly notifications are scheduled using a "CRON" syntax in the application.conf file (key = email.weekly.cron).    

PDF Help
The PDF help file is at \public\help\Noise_Registry_Help.pdf.  
To update it, replace the file with one which has the same file name.
