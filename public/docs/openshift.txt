OpenShift Staging
=================

OpenShift is being used for initial pre-QA review.  Pushing the application to OpenShift is a Tron Systems task.
 
The application will push to OpenShift correctly, but manual steps are needed to get it to run.

The OpenShift repository settings can be found by logging in to OpenShift (https://openshift.redhat.com/).
The following need to be installed first:
	- OpenShift client tools (including Ruby and Git) (https://developers.openshift.com/en/getting-started-overview.html)
	- GitHub for Windows (https://windows.github.com/)
	- Putty (see https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-remote-connection.html#download-the-putty-installer)

To avoid any problems with eclipse pushing to multiple remote locations, it is recommended that this is run from a 
command line in GitShell (part of GitHub for Windows).  Navigate to the project directory first.

The first time you do this run the following to set up the git repository keys:
>rhc setup  (this may need to be done every 30 days)

The first time the repository is synched you will need to run the following:
>git remote add openshift -f ssh://OPENSHIFT_USER@OPENSHIFT_SERVER/~/git/jncc.git/  
then
>git merge openshift/master -s recursive -X ours

Subsequently you will only need to run the following to update it on OpenShift:
>git push openshift master

This will take a long time to complete, with messages from the remote end as activator performs its resource resolving
and compilation steps.  This normally seems to fail (Connection closed by remote host) after the packaging of the 
javadoc jar file is complete - in that case:

open an ssh connection (using Putty) to the openshift server (ssh OPENSHIFT_USER@OPENSHIFT_SERVER)
cd play2/bin
./control build
./control start

This should complete fairly quickly, and at this point the application will be available at:
http://jncc-trondev1.rhcloud.com

Liquibase changes will need to be done using the Liquibase instructions.  The following instructions for port forwarding will be needed first:
https://blog.openshift.com/getting-started-with-port-forwarding-on-openshift/
rhc port-forward -a jncc (in GitShell)

The admin user may need access: 
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA jncc TO adminhmjmrkx
In pgAdmin.exe use show search_path; to check it is jncc,public
Use set search_path to jncc,public; to set it if necessary (though this has now been done)
