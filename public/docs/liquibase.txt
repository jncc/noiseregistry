Liquibase
=========

Liquibase is used for version control of both schema and data database changes. 

INSTALLATION
============

Liquibase 3.3.0 is used for databases changes. Liquibase can be downloaded from http://www.liquibase.org/download/index.html to a client with access to PostgreSQL on port 5432.

The PostgreSQL JDBC driver is needed.  It can be downloaded from: http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html 

TO UPDATE DATABASE CHANGES
==========================

Once downloaded and installed the Liquibase update can be run and rerun at any time.  Liquibase 
records which changes have been executed on the database and so updates will always only be applied if
they haven't already been applied to this database and will be applied in the correct order.
 
Before running ensure that you know the following:
1) Where is the postgresql-9.3-1102.jdbc3.jar (JDBC3 version) file on your system?
2) Where is the changelog.xml file which is part of the application distribution?
3) Where is the PostgreSQL server?
4) What is the name of the database?
5) What is the database username?
6) What is the database user's password?
7) What is the schema name? 
 
The command should be run on one line (not on separate lines as displayed below) from the ..\public\docs\scahema_changes directory 

/path/to/liquibase.bat --driver=org.postgresql.Driver --classpath=/path/to/postgresql-9.3-1102.jdbc3.jar 
--changeLogFile=/path/to/schema_changes/changelog.xml --url="jdbc:postgresql://server:5432/database" 
--username=xxxx --password=xxxx --defaultSchemaName=jncc update

The command should return with SUCCESS.
